## MMM-EOL

## The Encyclopedia of Life

## Here's what you get

* First, you are greeted by Charles Darwin on the cover of the encyclopedia.

* Then, a rotation of images and information about the life form you choose.

* Virtually every form of life on Earth to choose from. (Plants, Fish, Mammals, Reptiles etc..)

* I will add life forms as requested. There's just too many to include all of them.

* "Cats" will include ALL cats, or you can choose a specific species. (Lions, Tigers, etc..)
